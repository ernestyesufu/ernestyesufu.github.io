I used Python for data cleaning, PostgreSQL for data transformation and integration, and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.

## 🔧 Tools Used

## 🧰 Project Steps
1. Cleaned and transformed Excel data using Python.
2. Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
3. Used SQL to join and aggregate data across orders, products, customers, payments, and credit cards.
4. Visualized insights such as total revenue, products performance, customer analysis, and payment insights using Power BI dashboards.
